# Basic ETL
This exercise will take a csv file and manipulate it into a convenient format for a database. The process will include: 
1. Take the raw data from the Excel file
2. Transform the raw data into an installation script
3. Run the script against the database to insert the data into the database
4. Run some analytics on the data from the database via SQL query or via Jupyter Notbookes and some python packages
